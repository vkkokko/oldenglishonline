                                is the linguistic reconstruction of the common ancestor of all Indo-European languages,
                                including Old English.
                                PIE is estimated to have been spoken as a single language from 4500 BC to 2500 BC and
                                all Celtic, Germanic, Hellenic, Indo-Iranian and Romance languages are descended from
                                it. This is why many of the words used in Old English bear a resemblance to
                                words in other languages. For example, the PIE word for 2 is <em>'duwo'</em>. The 'd'
                                softens to a 't' in Old Germanic to become <em>'twai'</em>, so in Old English we get
                                <em>twa</em>, which became the modern English <em>two</em>, the modern Swedish
                                <em>två</em>, the modern German
                                <em>zwei</em> and the modern Icelandic <em>tveir</em>.

                                    language</strong>, and so has many of the quirks of Germanic languages such as an
                                inflectional case system, grammatical genders and runic letters. The grammatical shift
                                known
                                as i-mutation took place separately in various Germanic languages from
                                around 450 or 500 AD, and it was also around this time that the Germanic tribes known
                                as the
                                Angles, Saxons and Jutes began to settle in Britain. These tribes brought their
                                language and culture with them as they displaced the native Celtic language speakers,
                                which
                                is why English speakers have 'one tooth', but 'many teeth', and you see 'a man' but
                                'many men'. Old English had the same mutation, sometimes for words which are now
                                regular, for example, <em>boc - book</em> but <em>bec - books</em>, and used it
                                extensively
                                in its formation of verbs.

                                century, when the village of Ruthwell, Scotland, was part of the Kingdom of Northumbria. A runic inscription surrounds the carving on one side of the

                                carvings,
                                possibly as late as the 10th century. The runes are distinct from Norse Futhark, and
                                are
                                generally

                            <p><strong><span class="initial-letter lightorange-text">T</span>he Vikings</strong> began
                                to raid England in the late 8th century, and eventually the Great Heathen Army arrived
                                to conquor and settle. Much like the Angles, Jutes and Saxons that came before them,
                                they brought their language - Old Norse - with them.
                                This Scandinavian influence is still evident in many of placenames, especially in the
                                North-East of England, with towns like <em>Wetherby - Sheep's town</em> and
                                <em>Scunthorpe
                                    - Skuma's homestead</em>.
                                However, another effect the Vikings had was related to existing dialects of English.
                                The four main dialects were Mercian, Northumbrian, Kentish and West Saxon.
                                The Northumbrian dialect, which was spoken as far north as Edinburgh, survives as the
                                Scots language spoken in Scotland and parts of Northern Ireland. Modern English derives
                                mostly from the Anglian dialect, however, it is the West Saxon dialect of Old English
                                which is commonly taught.
                                This is because, under the rule of King Alfred, Wessex survived mostly intact, while others
                                did not. As a result, a great many surviving texts, including the vitally important
                                <em>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</em> and famous <em>Beowulf</em>, are written in the West
                                Saxon dialect of Old English.

                            <p><strong><span class="initial-letter lightorange-text">B</span>eowulf</strong> is perhaps
                                the most famous of all Old English texts, and while the date of composition is hotly
                                contested, the manuscript was most likely produced between 975 and 1025.
                                The poem has no title in the manuscript, and is preceeded by a life of Saint
                                Christopher, the
                                Wonders of the East, and a translation of a letter from Alexander to Aristotle. Another
                                heroic epic, Judith, follows Beowulf in the manuscript, though damage to some pages show
                                that Judith preceeded Beowulf at some point in the manuscripts binding.
                                The scribe writing Beowulf changes part-ways through the poem, and as a result,
                                the poem mixes the West Saxon and Anglian dialects of Old English, though it
                                predominantly uses West Saxon, another reason for the dominance of the West Saxon
                                dialect in academic teaching.

                                1066 heralded the most significant change for Old English, as it was the beginning
                                of the Norman conquest of England. With William the Conqueror's victory, the ruling
                                elite
                                became dominated by Old Norman speakers, and though English continued to be used by the
                                common people, Norman French was the language of the elite. As a result,
                                French grammar and loan words began to slowly creep into vernacular usage. This
                                is why in Modern English we use <em>'cow'</em> derived from the Old English
                                <em>'cu'</em>,
                                for the animal, but call its meat 'beef' from the French <em>'bœuf'</em>.

                                considered to be the final example of an Old English poem and presents a transitional
                                text between Old and Middle English. Found in <i>Bodley 343</i>, the poem tells the
                                story of a soul speaking to its body; a motif found in two other Old English poems and
                                many Middle English texts.
                                Though the manuscript is from the 12th century, by which time Old English was
                                undergoing
                                its transformation into Middle English, the language used in The Grave has
                                anachronistic markers indicating it was copied from an older source.

                                the name given to the distinctly different form of English which emerged due to the
                                intermingling of Norman and Old English. Over the 300 years following the conquest,
                                English lost its eth (&eth;) and thorn (&thorn;), as these did not exist in
                                Norman. Grammar distinctions were lost as many noun and adjective endings were
                                simplified to just '-e'.
                                With a few notable exceptions such as 'oxen' and 'children', plural endings were
                                simplified to '-s', and grammatical gender was discarded. However, Norman eventually
                                began to decline in popularity, and vernacular English literature began to reappear
                                after 1200. The Provisions of Oxford, released in 1258, was the first English
                                government document to be published in the English language after the Norman Conquest.

                                reasserted itself as the national language of Britain in the 14th Century. In 1362,
                                Edward III became the first king of England to address Parliament in English.
                                The <em>Pleading in English Act</em> 1362 made English the only language in which court
                                proceedings could be held, though official records often remained in Latin. By the end
                                of the century, even the royal court had switched to English.
                                Geoffrey Chaucer, who lived in the late 14th century, is considered the father of
                                English literature
                                as he was one of the earliest and most famous writers to write predominantly in English
                                during
                                the Middle English period. His seminal work, <em>The Canterbury Tales</em> is
                                taught in British schools even today.</p>

                                was not standardised and often reflected the pronunciation of the word more closely
                                than
                                modern English spelling. This is due to the Great Vowel Shift which took place during
                                the 15th century. Through this vowel shift, all Middle English long vowels and some
                                consonant sounds changed their pronunciation, with some letters becoming 'silent'.
                                The language was further transformed by the spread of a standardized
                                London-based dialect in government and administration and by the standardizing effect
                                of printing. This standardisation and phonetic shift marked the transition from
                                Middle English to Early Modern English.
