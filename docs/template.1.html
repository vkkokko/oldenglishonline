                <h1>The History of English</h1>
                <p class="padding-bottom">Modern English is a language shaped by the many political and social events
                    that impacted Britain over the course of history. Though English is classified as a Germanic
                    language, more than half of its vocabulary is derived from Romance languages such as French,
                    Italian, and Spanish, and many commonly used nouns were adopted wholesale from languages as diverse
                    as Greek, Persian, Hindi-Urdu and Native American languages. To understand why we say goose and
                    geese but not moose and meese, or why you have teeth and not tooths, it is necessary to understand
                    the sociopolitical history of English itself.

                                    <p><strong><span class="initial-letter lightorange-text">P</span>roto Indo European</strong>
                                        is the linguistic reconstruction of the common ancestor of all Indo-European
                                        languages,
                                        including Old English.
                                        PIE is estimated to have been spoken as a single language from 4500 BC to 2500
                                        BC
                                        and
                                        all Celtic, Germanic, Hellenic, Indo-Iranian and Romance languages are
                                        descended
                                        from
                                        it. This is why many of the words used in Old English bear resemble
                                        words in other languages. For example, the PIE word for 2 is <em>'duwo'</em>.
                                        The
                                        'd'
                                        softens to a 't' in Old Germanic to become <em>'twai'</em>, so in Old English
                                        we
                                        get
                                        <em>twa</em>, which became the modern English <em>two</em>, the modern Swedish
                                        <em>två</em>, the modern German
                                        <em>zwei</em> and the modern Icelandic <em>tveir</em>.</p>

                                            English</strong> is a Germanic language, and so has many of the quirks of
                                        Germanic languages
                                        such as an inflectional case system, grammatical genders and runic letters. The
                                        grammatical shift known as i-mutation took place separately in various Germanic
                                        languages from around 450 or 500 AD, and it was also around this time that the
                                        Germanic tribes known as the Angles, Saxons and Jutes began to settle in
                                        Britain.
                                        These tribes brought their language and culture with them as they displaced the
                                        native Celtic language speakers, which is why English speakers have 'one
                                        tooth',
                                        but 'many teeth', and you see 'a man' but 'many men'. Old English had the same
                                        mutation, sometimes for words which are now regular, for example, boc - book
                                        but bec - books, and used it extensively in its formation of verbs.

                                        is considered to be the oldest
                                        surviving non-runic record of Old English poetry. Its composition is estimated
                                        to between 658 and 680, with it surviving copies
                                        being recorded in the early part of the 8th century. It is attested in 19
                                        verified manuscript witness, all of which are copies of the <em>Historia
                                            Ecclesiastica</em>. The hymn is a short eulogistic verse, attributed to
                                        Cædmon, an illiterate cow-herd employed by the monastery of Whitby.</p>

                                        is a stone cross probably dating from the 7th or 8th
                                        century, when the village of Ruthwell, Scotland, was part of the Anglo-Saxon
                                        Kingdom of Northumbria. A runic inscription surrounds the carving on one side
                                        of the
                                        cross, though it is widely believed these runes were added later than the rest
                                        of the
                                        carvings,
                                        possibly as late as the 10th century. The runes are distinct from Norse
                                        Futhark, and
                                        are generally referred to as Anglo-Saxon runes.

                                        <strong><span class="initial-letter lightorange-text">T</span>he Vikings</strong>
                                        began
                                        to raid England in the late 8th century, and eventually the Great Heathen Army
                                        arrived
                                        to conquor and settle. Much like the Angles, Jutes and Saxons that came before
                                        them,
                                        they brought their language - Old Norse - with them.
                                        This Scandinavian influence is still evident in many of placenames, especially
                                        in the
                                        North-East of England, with towns like <em>Wetherby - Sheep's town</em> and
                                        <em>Scunthorpe
                                            - Skuma's homestead</em>.
                                        However, another effect the Vikings had was related to existing dialects of
                                        English.
                                        The four main dialects were Mercian, Northumbrian, Kentish and West Saxon.
                                        The Northumbrian dialect, which was spoken as far north as Edinburgh, survives
                                        as the
                                        Scots language spoken in Scotland and parts of Northern Ireland. Modern English
                                        derives
                                        mostly from the Anglian dialect, however, it is the West Saxon dialect of Old
                                        English
                                        which is commonly taught.
                                        This is because, under the rule of King Alfred, Wessex survived mostly intact
                                        and, as a
                                        result, a great many surviving texts, including the vitally important <em>Anglo-Saxon
                                            Chronicle</em>,
                                        are written in the West Saxon dialect of Old English.

                                        is perhaps
                                        the most famous of all Old English texts, and while the date of composition is
                                        hotly
                                        contested, the manuscript was most likely produced between 975 and 1025.
                                        The poem has no title in the manuscript, and is preceeded by a life of Saint
                                        Christopher, the
                                        Wonders of the East, and a translation of a Letter of Alexander to Aristotle.
                                        Another
                                        heroic epic, Judith, follows Beowulf though damage to some pages show that
                                        Judith
                                        preceeded Beowulf at some point in the manuscripts binding.
                                        The scribe writing Beowulf changes part-ways through the poem, and as a result,
                                        the poem mixes the West Saxon and Anglian dialects of Old English, though it
                                        predominantly uses West Saxon, another reason for the dominance of the West

                                        beginning
                                        of the Norman conquest of England. With William the Conquorers victory, the
                                        ruling
                                        elite
                                        became dominated by Old Norman speakers, and though English continued to be
                                        used by the
                                        common people, Norman French was the language of the elite. As a result,
                                        French grammar and loan words began to slowly creep into vernacular usage. This
                                        is why in Modern English we use <em>'cow'</em> derived from the Old English
                                        <em>'cu'</em>,
                                        for the animal, but call its meat 'beef' from the French <em>'bœuf'</em>.

                                        intermingling of Norman and Old English. Over the 300 years following the
                                        conquest,
                                        English lost its eth (&eth;) and thorn (&thorn;), as these did not exist in
                                        Norman. Grammar distinctions were lost as many noun and adjective endings were
                                        simplified to just '-e'.
                                        With a few notable exceptions such as 'oxen' and 'children', plural endings
                                        were
                                        simplified to '-s', and grammatical gender was discarded. However, Norman
                                        eventually
                                        began to decline in popularity, and vernacular English literature began to
                                        reappear
                                        after 1200. The Provisions of Oxford, released in 1258, was the first English

                                        reasserted itself as the national language of Britain in the 14th Century. In

                                        Edward III became the first king of England to address Parliament in English.

                                        English literature
                                        as he was one of the earliest and most famous writers to write predominantly in
                                        English
                                        during
                                        the Middle English period. His seminal work, <em>The Canterbury Tales</em> is
                                        taught in British schools even today.

                                        was not standardised and often reflected the pronunciation of the word more
                                        closely
                                        than
                                        modern English spelling. This is due to the Great Vowel Shift which took place
                                        during
                                        the 15th century. Through this vowel shift, all Middle English long vowels and
                                        some
                                        consonant sounds changed their pronunciation, with some letters becoming
                                        'silent'.
                                        The language was further transformed by the spread of a standardized
                                        London-based dialect in government and administration and by the standardizing
                                        effect
                                        of printing. This standardisation and phonetic shift marked the transition from
                                        Middle English to Early Modern English.
