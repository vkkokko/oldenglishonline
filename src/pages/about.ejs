			<h2 class="darkorange-text">What is this website?</h2>
			<p>
				<span class="darkorange-text initial-letter">O</span>ld English Online was originally
				designed and developed by Victoria Koivisto-Kokko at University College Cork as part of her Master’s
				thesis in 2018. The primary aim of the research was to test cognitive theories of learning online and
				ascertain the optimal design for an online course
				aimed at teaching medieval languages. Using Old English as the core subject, a course design
				and environmental design were researched using a combination of faculty interviews, persona testing,
				and research on cognitive theories of learning. With this information, a prototype of this website
				was built and tested using group comparison testing and after-scenario questionnaires.
			</p>
			<h2 class="darkorange-text">Is it still being developed?</h2>
			<p>
				<span class="darkorange-text initial-letter">Y</span>es! While the MA is over, the project continues to
				be developed and streamlined. The project is currently funded by the National Forum’s 'Developing
				Disciplinary Excellence in Learning,
				Teaching and Assessment' fund and was officially launched in November 2019. You can find a list of
				updates in the <a href="patchnotes.html" class="darkorange-text">patch notes</a>.
			</p>
			<h2 class="darkorange-text">How does it work?</h2>
			<p>
				<span class="darkorange-text initial-letter">T</span>he website is structured so that major
				grammatical concepts are covered in an individual module, which is subdivided into
				topics. Topics contain textual information accompanied by graphic organisers and interactive
				fill-in-the-blank questions which provide explanatory feedback. Questions are either drawn
				directly from, or inspired by, the corpus of Old English literature, and the environment is
				specifically designed to require the minimum amount of cognitive processing. In the overview
				topic of each module, you can download a pdf version of the module content which also contains a
				glossary of the Old English words used in the module, and test new vocabulary using a flashcard
				test.
			</p>
			<h2 class="darkorange-text">How much content is there?</h2>
			<p>
				<span class="darkorange-text initial-letter">A</span> list of the modules can be found on the
				<a href="courseindex.html" class="darkorange-text">Index</a> page. Incomplete modules cannot be
				selected, however, this project is still in development with new modules being added as soon as
				they are completed. The project is still a work in progress, so if you feel there is
				something which could be improved then please do not hesitate to provide feedback using the email
				in the footer.
			</p>
			<h2 class="darkorange-text">Can you see my answers?</h2>
			<p><span class="initial-letter darkorange-text">N</span>ope! The tool runs exclusively in the browser so
				anything you do on the
				website can not be seen by anyone except you. The only data we collect is page hits to see what parts of
				the site people are using.</p>
			<h2 class="darkorange-text">Can I do anything to help the resource?</h2>
			<p>
				<span class="darkorange-text initial-letter">I</span>f you notice any errors or bugs, please don't
				hesitate to email them in to <span class="darkorange-text">contact@oldenglish.info</span>. Similarly,
				if there is a missing feature you feel should be included, please feel free to request its addition.
				If you want it, chances are someone else does too!
			</p>
			<h2 class="darkorange-text">Where else can I find stuff?</h2>
			<p>
				<span class="darkorange-text initial-letter">F</span>or those interested in additional
				Old English learning resources, you can find a comprehensive overview on
