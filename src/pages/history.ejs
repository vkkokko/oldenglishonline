						<p><strong><span class="initial-letter lightorange-text">P</span>roto Indo European</strong>
							is the linguistic reconstruction of the common ancestor of all Indo-European languages,
							including Old English.
							PIE is estimated to have been spoken as a single language from 4500 BC to 2500 BC and
							all Celtic, Germanic, Hellenic, Indo-Iranian and Romance languages are descended from
							it. This is why many of the words used in Old English bear a resemblance to
							words in other languages. For example, the PIE word for 2 is <em>'duwo'</em>. The 'd'
							softens to a 't' in Old Germanic to become <em>'twai'</em>, so in Old English we get
							<em>twa</em>, which became the modern English <em>two</em>, the modern Swedish
							<em>två</em>, the modern German
							<em>zwei</em> and the modern Icelandic <em>tveir</em>.</p>

						<p><strong><span class="initial-letter lightorange-text">O</span>ld English is a Germanic
								language</strong>, and so has many of the quirks of Germanic languages such as an
							inflectional case system, grammatical genders and runic letters. The grammatical shift
							known
							as i-mutation took place separately in various Germanic languages from
							around 450 or 500 AD, and it was also around this time that the Germanic tribes known
							as the
							Angles, Saxons and Jutes began to settle in Britain. These tribes brought their
							language and culture with them as they displaced the native Celtic language speakers,
							which
							is why English speakers have 'one tooth', but 'many teeth', and you see 'a man' but
							'many men'. Old English had the same mutation, sometimes for words which are now
							regular, for example, <em>boc - book</em> but <em>bec - books</em>, and used it
							extensively
							in its formation of verbs.

						<h2>9<sup>th</sup> Century</h2>
					</div>
					<div class="timeline-content">
						<p><strong><span class="initial-letter lightorange-text">T</span>he Vikings</strong> began
							to raid England in the late 8th century, and eventually the Great Heathen Army arrived
							to conquor and settle. Much like the Angles, Jutes and Saxons that came before them,
							they brought their language - Old Norse - with them.
							This Scandinavian influence is still evident in many of placenames, especially in the
							North-East of England, with towns like <em>Wetherby - Sheep's town</em> and
							<em>Scunthorpe
								- Skuma's homestead</em>.
							However, another effect the Vikings had was related to existing dialects of English.
							The four main dialects were Mercian, Northumbrian, Kentish and West Saxon.
							The Northumbrian dialect, which was spoken as far north as Edinburgh, survives as the
							Scots language spoken in Scotland and parts of Northern Ireland. Modern English derives
							mostly from the Anglian dialect, however, it is the West Saxon dialect of Old English
							which is commonly taught.
							This is because, under the rule of King Alfred, Wessex survived mostly intact, while others
							did not. As a result, a great many surviving texts, including the vitally important 
							<em>Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</em> and famous <em>Beowulf</em>, are written in the West 
							Saxon dialect of Old English.

						<h2>10<sup>th</sup> Century</h2>
					</div>
					<div class="timeline-content">
						<p><strong><span class="initial-letter lightorange-text">B</span>eowulf</strong> is perhaps
							the most famous of all Old English texts, and while the date of composition is hotly
							contested, the manuscript was most likely produced between 975 and 1025.
							The poem has no title in the manuscript, and is preceeded by a life of Saint
							Christopher, the
							Wonders of the East, and a translation of a letter from Alexander to Aristotle. Another
							heroic epic, Judith, follows Beowulf in the manuscript, though damage to some pages show 
							that Judith preceeded Beowulf at some point in the manuscripts binding.
							The scribe writing Beowulf changes part-ways through the poem, and as a result,
							the poem mixes the West Saxon and Anglian dialects of Old English, though it
							predominantly uses West Saxon, another reason for the dominance of the West Saxon
							dialect in academic teaching.

						<p><strong><span class="initial-letter lightorange-text">T</span>he Battle of
								Hastings</strong> in
							1066 heralded the most significant change for Old English, as it was the beginning
							of the Norman conquest of England. With William the Conqueror's victory, the ruling
							elite
							became dominated by Old Norman speakers, and though English continued to be used by the
							common people, Norman French was the language of the elite. As a result,
							French grammar and loan words began to slowly creep into vernacular usage. This
							is why in Modern English we use <em>'cow'</em> derived from the Old English
							<em>'cu'</em>,
							for the animal, but call its meat 'beef' from the French <em>'bœuf'</em>.

						<p><strong><span class="initial-letter lightorange-text">T</span>he Grave</strong> is

							text between Old and Middle English. Found in <i>Bodley 343</i>, the poem tells the
							story of a soul speaking to its body; a motif found in two other Old English poems and
							many Middle English texts.
							Though the manuscript is from the 12th century, by which time Old English was
							undergoing
							its transformation into Middle English, the language used in The Grave has
							anachronistic markers indicating it was copied from an older source.

						<p><strong><span class="initial-letter lightorange-text">M</span>iddle English</strong> is
							the name given to the distinctly different form of English which emerged due to the
							intermingling of Norman and Old English. Over the 300 years following the conquest,
							English lost its eth (&eth;) and thorn (&thorn;), as these did not exist in
							Norman. Grammar distinctions were lost as many noun and adjective endings were
							simplified to just '-e'.
							With a few notable exceptions such as 'oxen' and 'children', plural endings were
							simplified to '-s', and grammatical gender was discarded. However, Norman eventually
							began to decline in popularity, and vernacular English literature began to reappear
							after 1200. The Provisions of Oxford, released in 1258, was the first English
							government document to be published in the English language after the Norman Conquest.
